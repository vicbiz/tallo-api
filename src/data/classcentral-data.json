The One Health approach supports global health security by enhancing the communication, collaboration and coordination, at the human-animal-environment interface to address shared health threats such as zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, food safety and others. In view of India emerging as a zoonotic hotspot and to combat this a holistic approach of \u0026lsquo;One Health\u0026rsquo; has gained importance to establish links between multi-sectors involving human health, animal health and environment. This course will give you a brief history and evolution of One Health concept, its application, relevance and success. Knowledge on zoonotic diseases, current scenario of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, measures to control and ways to reach out to community is part of the course with alignment to public health policies. The course is designed for the students, early career researchers, clinicians and policy makers to get an insight into \u0026ldquo;One health\u0026rdquo; and its importance in view of emerging and remerging infectious diseases of public health importance.The key to this holistic approach is to establish linkages between the human health, animal health and husbandry, agriculture, and environment sectors.INTENDED AUDIENCE: Candidates with any Graduate and Post Graduate degree related to Health sciences, Biomedical sciences, Life sciences, Environmental Sciences, Veterinary sciences and Public Health and interested to work on One Health can apply.PREREQUISITES: Any Graduate and Post Graduate degree related to Health sciences, Biomedical sciences, Life sciences, Environmental Sciences, Veterinary sciences and Public Health.INDUSTRY SUPPORT: Microbiology, Life Sciences, Public Health, Community Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Policy Makers and other relevant organizations across the country would be more benefited with this course.\u003C\/div\u003E\r\n\u003C\/div\u003E","syllabus":"\u003Cdiv\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv\u003EWeek 1 : Introduction to One Health\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cdiv\u003EIntroduction to the One Health One Medicine Concept and National \u0026amp;

In this foundation module, you will learn the importance of Balance and Interactions, as poor Balance and Interactions lead to body function deficiencies. Common examples of body function deficiencies encountered by many city dwellers are illustrated. Prof. Ko also explains how different Chinese Medicines can prevent and\/or treat these deficiencies. Some people may make use of Modern Medicine, such as Vitamins, for preventive health, Prof. Ko also compares and contrasts the difference between Chinese Medicine and Modern Medicine in preventive health.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPharmacological Basis of Chinese Tonifying Herbs\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn the last foundation module, Prof. Ko explains, in the language of Modern Medicine, the pharmacological basis of different kinds of Chinese Tonifying Herbs - (1) Yang and Qi invigoration, (2) Yin Nourishment and (3) Blood Enrichment, We also look into different examples of Chinese Medicine for their effects and applications.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESeminar 1: Yin and Yang: A Pharmacological Perspective\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EChinese Medicine concerns about Yin Yang Balance, as Yin Yang balance generates Qi, which can circulate along the Meridian and nourish different organs. In this seminar series, Prof. Ko explains how  Yin Yang is related to Modern Medicine. Chinese Medicine also believes that Chinese tonifying herbs can restore the Yin Yang balance in body function and hence a healthy body status. The seminar series also describes how different Chinese tonifying herbs can enhance the physiological function by means of activating energy metabolism, stimulating immunomodulatory action, enhancing antioxidation ability, etc.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESeminar 2: Yang Invigoration and Yin Nourishment\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFrom the previous seminar series, we understand that Yang is primarily related to energy metabolism while Yin is primarily related to the immune system in our body.

In the last module of the course, Prof. Ko gives a thorough explanation of the nature of Qi from the biochemical perspective. Schisandra Berry - a common Qi invigorating tonifying herb is used for illustration on how Qi invigoration is important to our health. Due to the gradual change of diseases over the past century from the prevalence of infectious diseases to age-associated diseases, Chinese Medicine is highly regarded as a gold mine for exploring alternative ways to prevent and treat these diseases. Prof. Ko wraps up the course by summarizing the use of different categories of Chinese tonifying herbs and when we should use them for preventive health.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E","status":0,"sessionStatus":101,"certificate":true,"freeCertificate":false,"certificatePrice":-1,"certificateDisplay":"Paid Certificate Available","durationMin":6,"durationMax":6,"durationDisplay":"6 weeks long","price":0,"pricePeriod":"T","priceDisplay":"Free Online Course (Audit)","shortName":"coursera_health-concepts-chinese-medicine","showDate":true,"isPaid":false,"isFree":true,"level":"beginner","childCourses":0,"imageUrl":"https:\/\/d3f1iyfxxz8i1e.cloudfront.net\/courses\/course_image\/299781934c93.jpg","imageVariants":{"image\/webp":[{"size":"240w","url":"https:\/\/d3f1iyfxxz8i1e.cloudfront.net\/courses\/course_image_variant\/299781934c93_w240.webp"},{"size":"480w","url":"https:\/\/d3f1iyfxxz8i1e.cloudfront.net\/courses\/course_image_variant\/299781934c93_w480.webp"},{"size":"740w","url":"https:\/\/d3f1iyfxxz8i1e.cloudfront.net\/courses\/course_image_variant\/299781934c93_w740.webp"},{"size":"1200w","url":"https:\/\/d3f1iyfxxz8i1e.cloudfront.net\/courses\/course_image_variant\/299781934c93_w1200.webp"}]},"url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/health-concepts-chinese-medicine","created":"2017-10-04T17:35:26+0000","lastModified":"2022-11-06T03:32:02+0000","providerRating":4.66269,"providerNumRatings":335,"providerNumEnrollments":22674,"creators":"Robert Ko","language":{"name":"English","id":1,"slug":"english"},"institutions":[{"id":31,"name":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","url":"http:\/\/www.ust.hk\/","slug":"hkust","isUniversity":true,"description":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology is a top-tier, international research university ranked among the world\u0027s best.
